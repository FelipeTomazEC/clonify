# Clonify

Clonify is a clone of the famous desktop version of the Spotify application.

### Built With

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) - Library to create web pages.
- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) - Official API to access resources from Spotify.

### Features

- Fetch user's public playlists;
- Fetch user's followed podcasts;
- Fetch user's recent played playlists and albums;
- Friend Activity Feed
  - Since Spotify Web API doesn't provide an endpoint to get the user's friends, the activities presented aren't from real people.
